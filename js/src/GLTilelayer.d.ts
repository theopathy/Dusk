/**
 * Due to the storage format used tileset images are limited to
 * 256 x 256 tiles, and there can only be up to 256 tilesets. Similarly
 * a multi-image tileset can only have up-to 256 images.
 *
 * Since a tileset sheet with 256x256 tiles at 16x16 tile size is 4096x4096
 * pixels I think this restriciton is probably OK. Additonally if you actually
 * approach the 256 image/tileset limit it will likely be a GPU bandwidth issue
 * long before it is an issue with our storage format here.
